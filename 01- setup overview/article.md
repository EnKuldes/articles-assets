## üß† Why I Built This Homelab

This has been one of my personal projects in 2024, but I hadn‚Äôt had the time (or motivation) to properly document it ‚Äî until now. 

The main reason I started this was because I had an old laptop (bought in 2014) that kept crashing. I reinstalled it about 3-4 times last year. Usually, my mom uses it for her work since she uses Excel on that. But now that it‚Äôs out of commission, I figured ‚Äî why not turn it into something fun and useful instead of tossing it? There are several ideas for it, one of which is, of course, to create a gaming device out of it, but after some thought rather than just focusing it as a game center, I thought how about a media server or even my own home lab to dev some app, and here we are. So this is what I'm gonna do for this old laptop, I'm gonna create a media server to store movies, animes, or series using Jellyfin, and also just found out that I can also manage my finance/log my income/outcome using Firefly III (I have been using google spreadsheet since 2019).

## üß∞ Hardware Setup

First, I'm gonna show my specs for Asus X455LA.

- CPU: i3-4030U 1.9Ghz, with 2 Core 4 Threads
- RAM: 6GB DDR3L 1333/1600 (2GB+4GB)
- GPU: Intel HD Graphics 4400 Mobile 2GB VRAM
- 2x USB 2.0
- 1x USB 3.0
- 1x Lan Port (RJ45)
- WiFi 802.11 b/g/n 
- HDD 500GB (Upgradeable with SSD Sata 2.5")
- HDD 500GB (connected using HDD caddy, replacing my DVD RW slot)

This server will be using **Ubuntu Server 24.04** as the main OS, while **docker** will be used to deploy the applications. There might be some apps that are unable to run with docker and are being installed on the OS itself.
